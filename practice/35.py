Question: Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
Example: 0100,0011,1010,1001 Then the output should be: 1010 Notes: Assume the data is input by console.
